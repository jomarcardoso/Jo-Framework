# Jo-Framework
a Framework CSS

Jo Framework is a CSS Framework that aims to get the most out of front-end work for less-familiar developers or others who want something ready to streamline development and devote more time to other parts of the project.
Jo Framework use _SASS_ to organize the code and allow developers more familiar with the tool to remove unused portions of CSS code and also add new ones that some nodes provide.
__We will not use "variables" and "mixins", we will only use "nested rules" and "inline imports" that SASS offers to organize the code.__

## Jo Sets
The CSS basis of the Framework will be the "_Jo Sets_" where it will bring the definitions that will be used in any project of the same.
The "__main.scss__" controls all imports, among them:
 * __color_palettes__ - Includes color palette imports (you should generally leave only one uncommented), you can create a new palette and import it as well.;
 * __font_group__ - Inclues font group imports (you should generally leave only one uncommented), you can create a new group and import it as well.;
